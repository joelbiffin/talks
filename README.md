# Talks Given in the Public Realm

An incomplete list of some talks I've given out in the wild. Maybe one day I'll get my act together and genuinely use this repo to develop them but who knows.

If you're interested in anything that I've spoken about then feel free to reach out to me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelbiffin/).

## LLGems: Re-using Code the Ruby Way

The talk takes a look under the hood of Cleo's Rails monolith, the Rails Engines, and how we share code between them. It's a bit like a kitchen experiment â€“ blending the best of both worlds to enhance the Separation of Concerns, while still keeping our favorite code recipes within reach.

I share Cleo's engineering adventure of moving some Kafka infrastructure code from the main Rails app into a local gem (with zero downtime!). Think of it as giving the code a new home where it can be shared across our Rails Engines. We've also managed to preserve our unique, in-house testing infrastructure in the process which is a serious Brucie bonus!
