# Talks Given in the Public Realm

## LLGems: Re-using Code the Ruby Way

The talk takes a look under the hood of Cleo's Rails monolith, the Rails Engines, and how we share code between them. It's a bit like a kitchen experiment â€“ blending the best of both worlds to enhance the Separation of Concerns, while still keeping our favorite code recipes within reach.

I share Cleo's engineering adventure of moving some Kafka infrastructure code from the main Rails app into a local gem (with zero downtime!). Think of it as giving the code a new home where it can be shared across our Rails Engines. We've also managed to preserve our unique, in-house testing infrastructure in the process which is a serious Brucie bonus!
